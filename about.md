The app was inspired by my wife when the other day she named a color I had no idea existed :-) 

Even though, there is a nice <a href='http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color' target='blank_'>page</a> and a <a href='http://chir.ag/projects/ntc/' target='blank_'>js library</a> by Chirag Mehta, I as an *R fan* decided to create a <a href='http://shiny.rstudio.com/' target='blank_'>shiny</a> <a href='https://www.dkisler.de/projects/shiny/name_the_color/' target='blank_'>app</a> to help myself and the others (especially to the men, it seems that we guys are '*color name blind*' :-) ) in identifying a color by its name and in identifying a color name by its <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors' target='blank_'>color code (HEX, or RGB)</a>.

If it happened that you cannot identify your color, please feel free to add it into the data base, I'll appreciate it.

The colors data (*name, hex and rgb codes*) are from the folowing sources (see <a href='https://github.com/kislerdm/name_the_color/blob/master/get_colors_info.ipynb' target='blank_'>details</a>) : <a href='http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Color/resenecolours.txt' target='blank_'>colors list</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors:_A%E2%80%93F" target='blank_'>wiki</a>.
