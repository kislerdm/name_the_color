The app was inspired by my wife when the other day she named a color I had no idea existed :-) 

Even though, there is a nice [page](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color) and a [js library](http://chir.ag/projects/ntc/) by Chirag Mehta, I as an *R fan* decided to create a [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) [app](https://www.dkisler.de/projects/shiny/name_the_color/) to help myself and the others (especially to the men, it seems that we guys are '*color name blind*' :-) ) in identifying a color by its name and in identifying a color name by its [color code (HEX, or RGB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors).

If it happened that you cannot identify your color, please feel free to add it into the data base, I'll appreciate it.

The colors data (*name, hex and rgb codes*) are from the folowing sources (see [details](https://github.com/kislerdm/name_the_color/blob/master/get_colors_info.ipynb)) : [colors_list](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Color/resenecolours.txt), [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors:_A%E2%80%93F)
